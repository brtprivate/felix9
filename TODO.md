# Production Error Fixes

## Issues Identified:
1. **CSP Framing Error**: WalletConnect iframe blocked by Content Security Policy
2. **Coinbase Metrics 401**: Unauthorized analytics requests despite analytics being disabled
3. **Multiple Web3Modal Customizations**: Excessive console logs from repeated customizer runs

## Tasks:
- [x] Add CSP headers to allow WalletConnect framing
- [x] Remove or fix Coinbase analytics calls (CSP allows the domain)
- [x] Optimize Web3Modal customizer to prevent multiple runs
- [ ] Test fixes in production environment
- [ ] Rebuild and redeploy application
